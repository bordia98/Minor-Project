Automated traffic light violation detection system
relies on the detection of the color of traffic light appeared in
video frames, detection of the white safety line before the traffic
signal and vehicles. Detection of the vehicles crossing traffic
signals is generally done with the help of sensors which get
triggered when the traffic signal turns red or yellow. Sometimes
these sensors get triggered even when the person crosses the line
or some animal crossover or because of some bad weather gives
false results. In this paper, we present a software which will work
on image processing and convolutional neural network to detect
the traffic signals, vehicles and the white safety line present in
front of the traffic signals. We present an efficient way to detect
the white safety line in this paper combined with the detection of
traffic lights trained on the bosch dataset and vehicle detection
using the tensorflow object detection SSD model.
